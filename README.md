# liri-node-app

Welcome to my liri-node-app.

Liri is similar to Apple's Siri, however it uses a language interpretation and recoginition interface. 

You can use Liri to search concerts, movies, or a song that the user types on the command line.

The commands that Liri accepts are: concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, and do-what-it-says.

Liri uses the spotify api, Bands in Town api, and the OMDB api to retrieve the information requested.
